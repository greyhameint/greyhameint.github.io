      <Typography paragraph>
        The games industry lacks innovation.
        The reason is simple - it's risky to bet big budgets on untested ideas.
        So developers stick to what's worked before, churning out sequel after sequel with formulaic gameplay.

        The catch is that to make great games that sell, developers need to push boundaries.
        The most successful games are made by the most creative teams,
        unshackled from the diktats of management.
